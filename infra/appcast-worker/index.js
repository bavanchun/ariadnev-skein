/**
 * Skein's Sparkle update feed.
 *
 * Sparkle reads SUFeedURL from a value baked into every shipped binary, so
 * pointing it straight at a GitHub repository means renaming or moving that
 * repository silently cuts off updates for everything already installed —
 * which is exactly what happened to Frost. This worker owns the address
 * instead, so the backing store can move without stranding anyone.
 *
 * It proxies rather than stores: GitHub Releases stays the source of truth,
 * and the appcast and its zips are served straight from there.
