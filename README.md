Skein is a menu bar manager for macOS. It hides and shows menu bar items, and gives you a set of tools for arranging and customising the menu bar around them.

It is part of the [Ariadnev](https://ariadnev.com) ecosystem.

**Skein is derived from [Ice](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice) by Jordan Baird**, and the overwhelming majority of its source code originates there. Skein is an independent project rather than a maintained fork: it has its own name, releases, and direction, and it is not affiliated with or endorsed by the upstream project. It remains licensed under GPL-3.0, and Jordan Baird's copyright is preserved in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). See [`docs/UPSTREAM.md`](docs/UPSTREAM.md) for the full provenance record.

## Install

Download the `Skein-<version>.zip` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/bavanchun/ariadnev-skein/releases/latest) and move the unzipped app into your `Applications` folder.

Skein is signed with a personal development certificate rather than a Developer ID, so on first launch macOS may require you to allow it explicitly in System Settings → Privacy & Security.

Skein needs Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions to manage and capture menu bar items.
